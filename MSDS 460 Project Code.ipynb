    "PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "NU Industries operates two manufacturing plants that produce three products: Widgets, Gadgets, and Flugels. The finished products are shipped to the Distribution Center for final distribution to the customers. Five periods of production are to be scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Sales Department, the production requirements that must be met due to contracts during the planning horizon are as follows (MSDS 460 Project Requirement Table 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the Marketing & Forecasting Department anticipates that NU Industries can cultivate additional demand within the distribution area through effective advertising. The M&F Department projects that each $160 invested in advertising Widgets in a particular period creates additional demand for one Widget in the next period. The corresponding values for Gadgets and Flugels are $120 and $180, respectively. However, the total advertising budget is limited to $70,000 for the entire planning horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the planning horizon, NU Industries will sell Widgets for $2490, Gadgets for $1990, and Flugels for $2970. The products can be manufactured at either of NU's Manufacturing Plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Engineering Department has provided the following manufacturing and inventory data.\n"
